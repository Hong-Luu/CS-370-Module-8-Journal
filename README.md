# CS 370 Module 8 Journal

In this project, I worked on creating an intelligent agent for a treasure hunt game. I was given some starter code, including files for the game environment and the pirate agent. My task was to implement the Q-learning algorithm to train the pirate agent to find the treasure in the game world.

The starter code provided me with the basic structure of the game environment, including the pathways and obstacles. It also gave me the framework for the pirate agent, defining its actions and interactions with the environment. However, I had to develop the Q-learning algorithm myself to enable the pirate agent to learn and navigate the game world effectively.

Throughout this project, I connected my learning to the broader field of computer science. Computer scientists work on solving problems using algorithms and data structures. They develop software systems, design algorithms, and analyze complex problems to create efficient solutions. Computer science matters because it drives technological innovation, enables automation, and improves efficiency across various industries.

Approaching a problem as a computer scientist involves several steps. First, it's important to understand the problem thoroughly, breaking it down into smaller, manageable parts. Then, we can analyze the requirements and constraints to determine possible solutions. Next, we design algorithms or develop software to implement these solutions. Testing and debugging are crucial to ensure the correctness and reliability of our implementations. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our solutions and iterate as needed to improve them.

As a computer scientist, I have ethical responsibilities to both the end user and the organization. I must ensure that the software I develop is safe, secure, and respects user privacy. It's essential to consider the potential impact of my work on society and the environment. Additionally, I should adhere to ethical guidelines and professional standards in my conduct as a practitioner of computer science. By upholding these responsibilities, I can contribute positively to the advancement of technology and the well-being of society.
